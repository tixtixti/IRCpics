# IRCpics

Fairly simple NodeJS server and Android app, for selecting picture on phone, hosting it
and sending a link to IRC channel. Uses PSQL for database queries.

Using server add app currently requires both devices to be in same network and change hardcoded IP address of server. Server side also requires working PSQL server.
----------------------------------------
Todo:
  - Refactoring
  - Frontend-desing on both ClientApp and Server-side
  - Possibility to add some text to image.
  - Possibility to select IRC-channel.
  - SQL security.
  - Some documentation.
  - Release in real internet.
